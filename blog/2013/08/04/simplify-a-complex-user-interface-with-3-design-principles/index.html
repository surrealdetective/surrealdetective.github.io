<p><img src="/images/visual-design-img-of-book.jpg" /></p>

<p>After programming for 9 weeks at Flatiron School, I picked up a book on visual design. It explains design concepts like professors who, at first glance, delve into gratuitous detail&hellip; until you realize how that info germinates your understanding. Better yet, the book offers useful steps for UI beginners to improve their designs intuitively. (And the book comes in green)</p>

<p><img src="/images/visual-design-book.jpg" /></p>

<p>Here are 3 tips I used from the book to&hellip;</p>

<h2>improve my UI design.</h2>

<h4>1. Reduce</h4>

<p>  Identify the functionality of a given thing, then eliminate unessential clutter. The books says wisely,</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Whereas art strives to <em>express</em> fundamental ideas and perspectives on the human condition, design is concerned with finding the <em>representation</em> best suited to the communication of some specific information&rdquo; (Mullet 9).</p></blockquote>

<p>  In other words, design serves a purpose, so the fundamental principle of good design is to know its own purpose. Just as how a ruby method shouldn&rsquo;t do too many things, the same applies to design &ndash; too many features will limit its usefulness.</p>

<h4>2. Balance by Rank</h4>

<p>  Chunk and label the elements of your design into named groups, then destablish a clear visual hierachy. This means ranking your named groups in order of importance from 1-7. In your design, the one or two most important elements must stand out, with others reduced to supporting roles. The process of ranking your design elements will give your creation process a purpose, as it will clarify what your design should achieve.</p>

<p>  Adjust the size and value of elements to make them stand out. In general, maximize perception difference between groups, but minimize them within like-objects.</p>

<h4>3. Regularize</h4>

<p>  Use a meaningful pattern to achieve a design&rsquo;s purpose by repeating similar elements. As a design beginner, my approach towards finding a meaningful pattern is to solve easier problems first. Then, if I can use those simple problem-solving patterns to also solve more complex ones, then that constitutes a meaningful pattern.</p>

<p>  Another approach is to look for repeated functionality within your app, find its simplest use case, then re-purpose it to more complex use cases.</p>

<h2>Case Study to Re-design UI</h2>

<p>For my team project at the Flatiron School, we&rsquo;re creating a website that helps Flatiron School process applicants to its classes. One of the views in the website lets the administrator search for applicants. Before, we had 5 columns and as many as 5 lines within a cell. The view bewildered users.</p>

<p>To improve the design, I first focused on what the page hoped to achieve &ndash; find applicants. More specifically, the administrator searches for applicants to then take a look at their entire application. Everything else should be eliminated or de-emphasized. Ultimately, this is what was left:</p>

<p><img src="/images/appapp-search-view.jpg" /></p>

<p>I then re-used this basic design for another view where the administrator is skimming through initial applications before reading the entire thing.</p>

<p>By using a familiar pattern, the app can utilize space more effectively. In this case, it can fit many actions into a relatively small space because the user has become accustomed to part of the view.</p>

<h2>Designing UI Takeaway</h2>

<p>By identifying the purpose of a design and communicating that purpose in a simple and elegant way, you can greatly improve your UI.</p>

<h5>Addendum</h5>

<p>After seeing the picture of traditional book layouts, I saw the manmade world around me as exactly that &ndash; manmade! I saw the intentional simplicity of all the designs around me, and it was amazing.</p>
