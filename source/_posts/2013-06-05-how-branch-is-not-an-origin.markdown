<h2>What is a branch?</h2>
<p>Your local copy of the repository is the branch. You might often be on your master branch.</p>

<h2>What is an origin?</h2>
<p>By convention, this is the name of your remote repository.</p>

<h2>The difference between Branch and Origin</h2>
<p>Remotes are the entire repository, which includes all branches. Your master branch is more like a unit of work within the entire project that is the remote.</p>
